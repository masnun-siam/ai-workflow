You are the `/ship` workflow. This is a **non-interactive, fully automated** workflow. Do NOT ask for confirmation at any step. The user said `/ship` which means DO IT. Run straight through and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- On the base branch (abort)
- Merge conflicts that can't be auto-resolved (stop, show conflicts)
- In-branch test failures (pre-existing failures are triaged, not auto-blocking)
- Pre-landing review finds ASK items that need user judgment
- MINOR or MAJOR version bump needed (ask — see Step 12)
- Greptile review comments that need user decision (complex fixes, false positives)
- AI-assessed coverage below minimum threshold (hard gate with user override — see Step 7)
- Plan items NOT DONE with no user override (see Step 8)
- Plan verification failures (see Step 8.1)
- TODOS.md missing and user wants to create one (ask — see Step 14)
- TODOS.md disorganized and user wants to reorganize (ask — see Step 14)

**Never stop for:**
- Uncommitted changes (always include them)
- Version bump choice (auto-pick MICRO or PATCH — see Step 12)
- CHANGELOG content (auto-generate from diff)
- Commit message approval (auto-commit)
- Multi-file changesets (auto-split into bisectable commits)
- TODOS.md completed-item detection (auto-mark)
- Auto-fixable review findings (dead code, N+1, stale comments — fixed automatically)
- Test coverage gaps within target threshold (auto-generate and commit, or flag in PR body)

**Re-run behavior (idempotency):**
Re-running `/ship` means "run the whole checklist again." Every verification step (tests, coverage audit, plan completion, pre-landing review, adversarial review, VERSION/CHANGELOG check, TODOS, document-release) runs on every invocation. Only *actions* are idempotent:
- Step 12: If VERSION already bumped, skip the bump but still read the version
- Step 17: If already pushed, skip the push command
- Step 19: If PR exists, update the body instead of creating a new PR
Never skip a verification step because a prior `/ship` run already performed it.

## GitNexus first

You are given gitnexus graph tools. Use them **before** Grep/Glob/Bash for any question about where code lives or what it touches:

| Question | Tool |
|---|---|
| Where does X live / how does it work | `mcp__gitnexus__query`, `mcp__gitnexus__context` |
| What breaks if I change X | `mcp__gitnexus__impact` |
| How does A reach B | `mcp__gitnexus__trace` |
| What do my current changes affect | `mcp__gitnexus__detect_changes` |

Pass `repo: "<name>"` explicitly — in a worktree the cwd is not the indexed path. Fall back to `Grep`/`Glob` only when the graph returns nothing useful, the symbol is too new to be indexed, or the tool reports the repo is not indexed. Never open with a repo-wide `grep -r` when `impact` or `context` answers the same question in one call.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`, `git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Check the current branch. If on the base branch or the repo's default branch, **abort**: "You're on the base branch. Ship from a feature branch."

2. Run `git status` (never use `-uall`). Uncommitted changes are always included — no need to ask.

3. Run `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` to understand what's being shipped.

4. Check review readiness:

## Review Readiness Dashboard

After completing the review, read the review log and config to display the dashboard.

```bash
$GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-review-read
```

## Step 2: Sync with base branch

1. Fetch the latest changes: `git fetch origin <base>`
2. Check if we're behind: `git rev-list --count HEAD..<base>`
3. If behind, merge the base branch: `git merge origin/<base>`
4. If merge conflicts, try to auto-resolve. If can't, stop and show conflicts.

## Step 3: Run tests

1. Look for test commands in package.json, Makefile, or common patterns
2. Run the test suite with a timeout
3. If tests fail, check if they're pre-existing failures (from base branch) or new ones
4. New failures = abort. Pre-existing failures = note in PR body.

## Step 4: Review diff

1. Run `git diff <base>...HEAD` to see all changes
2. Check for:
   - Security issues (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS)
   - Code quality issues (dead code, N+1 queries, missing error handling)
   - Performance issues
3. Auto-fix any issues found (dead code removal, stale comments, etc.)
4. If complex issues found that need user judgment, stop and ask.

## Step 5: Check plan completion (if applicable)

1. Look for plan files (PLAN.md, .plan, etc.)
2. Check if all items are marked DONE
3. If items NOT DONE, ask user if they want to proceed anyway
4. Run plan verification if verification commands exist

## Step 6: Check TODOS.md (if applicable)

1. Look for TODOS.md
2. Auto-mark completed items based on git log
3. If TODOS.md missing and user wants one, ask
4. If TODOS.md disorganized, ask if user wants to reorganize

## Step 7: Coverage check (if applicable)

1. Look for coverage configuration
2. Run coverage if available
3. Check if coverage meets threshold
4. If below threshold, ask user if they want to proceed

## Step 8: Bump VERSION

1. Look for VERSION file
2. Read current version
3. Determine bump type:
   - If breaking changes → MAJOR
   - If new features → MINOR
   - Otherwise → MICRO
4. Update VERSION file
5. If MINOR or MAJOR bump needed, ask user to confirm

## Step 9: Update CHANGELOG

1. Look for CHANGELOG.md
2. Generate changelog entry from git log
3. Prepend to CHANGELOG.md

## Step 10: Commit changes

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Create commit with message:
   - If VERSION bumped: "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
   - Otherwise: "chore: ship changes"
3. If multiple logical changes, split into separate commits

## Step 11: Push changes

1. Push to origin: `git push origin HEAD`
2. If already pushed, skip

## Step 12: Create PR/MR

**If GitHub:**
1. Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`
2. If PR exists, update body: `gh pr edit --body "..."`
3. If no PR, create one: `gh pr create --fill`

**If GitLab:**
1. Check if MR already exists: `glab mr view`
2. If MR exists, update description: `glab mr update --description "..."`
3. If no MR, create one: `glab mr create --fill`

**If unknown platform:**
1. Print the diff and log, ask user to create PR manually

## Step 13: Document release (if applicable)

1. Look for documentation that needs updating
2. Update README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.
3. Update CHANGELOG voice if needed

## Step 14: Final report

1. Print summary:
   - What was shipped
   - PR/MR URL
   - Any issues found and fixed
   - Any items that need user attention
2. If any concerns, list them

## Out of scope

- Creating new features (that's for development, not shipping)
- Refactoring beyond what's needed for the ship
- Adding tests (unless needed for coverage)
- Changing CI/CD configuration

## Budget discipline

This is a one-pass workflow. Don't loop back over steps unless a step explicitly requires it (like fixing review findings).
